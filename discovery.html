        Here's the <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/owlapi/https://raw.github.com/linked-statistics/disco-spec/master/discovery.ttl">LODE view</a> of the whole thing.

And <a href="https://github.com/linked-statistics/disco-spec/issues">open issues</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Scope and Purpose</h3>

      <p>This specification is designed to support the discovery of
      microdata sets and related metadata using RDF technologies in the
      Web of Linked Data. Many archives and other organizations have
      large amounts of data, sometimes publically available, but often
      confidential in nature, requiring applications for access. Many
      such organizations use the
      <a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/what">Data Documentation Initiative</a>
      standard, which is a proven and highly detailed XML metadata
      format for describing rectangular data sets of this type.
      This vocabulary leverages the DDI specification to create a
      simplified version of this model for the discovery of data files.</p>

      <p>The data holdings of data archives are often collected by
      researchers, and only afterwards disseminated by archives. Other
      data-producing organizations such as research centers and
      statistical agencies are also increasingly interested in the
      DDI standards for documenting their own micro-data. In general
      terms, most DDI metadata describes data sets for the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences. This data is fairly
      consistent in format, consisting of rectangular data files with
      columns containing variables for a set of cases, contained in
      the rows. It is often collected by survey, although in some
      cases may come from administrative sources, sensors, or
      registers.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is intended not only for use by the research
      data community, but also by any others needing an RDF vocabulary
      for describing this type of rectangular data. This vocabulary
      will provide a useful model for describing some of the data sets
      now being published by open government initiatives, by providing
      a rich metadata structure for them. While the data sets may be
      available (typically as CSV files) the metadata which
      accompanies them is not necessarily coherent, making the
      discovery of these data sets difficult. This vocabulary would
      help to overcome this difficulty by allowing for the creation of
      standard queries to programmatically identify data sets, whether
      made available by government or held within a data archive.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>About DDI</h3>

      <p>The Data Documentation Initiative standards are produced and
      maintained by a member-based consortium of global scope, the
      <a href="http://www.ddi-alliance.org/">DDI Alliance</a>. Housed
      currently at the
      <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/">Interuniversity Consortium
      for Political and Social Research</a> (ICPSR) at the University
      of Michigan, there are currently more than 30 member
      institutions. The standards have been under development for more
      than ten years, and are in widespread use among data archives
      and libraries, producers of research data, secure data centers,
      and statistical agencies.</p>

      <p>There are two major versions of DDI: the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">codebook</a>”
      version, which is an XML format for holding general information
      about a study, along with its data dictionary; and the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Lifecycle/">Lifecycle</a>”
      version of DDI, which allows for the description of more complex
      multi-wave studies, throughout the data lifecycle, from study 
      conception through data collection and processing.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is not specific to either of these versions,
      but represents the major types of metadata they contain in a
      highly simplified form, for the purposes of discovery. The XML
      Codebook and Lifecycle versions of DDI are very broad: these
      standards contain hundreds of metadata elements, providing
      enough information to programmatically work with the data files
      for such functions as the automatic creation of databases, and
      transformations between statistical packages. DDI in both
      versions is generally used to describe data found in ASCII
      files, whether positional files with fixed-width fields or files
      using a delimited format such as CSV.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to claim that there is a single agreed
      conceptual model for describing research data in the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences—there is a wide range of
      models and terms. However, the issues faced in this area have
      been the subject of discussion within the DDI community for many
      years, and the DDI model represents the best consensus which
      exists today. As such, it gives us a good basis for creating a
      vocabulary which will be recognizable to researchers familiar
      with this type of data.</p>

      <h2>Relationship to Data Cube, DCAT and XKOS</h2>

      <p>The Discovery Vocabulary is aligned to several other metadata
      vocabularies used in the RDF community.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">Data Catalog
      Vocabulary</a> (DCAT) is a W3C standard for describing catalogs
      of datasets, and we map to it in two places:
      Our LogicalDataSet is a subclass of DCAT’s Dataset, and our
      DataFile is a subclass of DCAT’s Distribution. DCAT makes few
      assumptions about the kind of datasets being described,
      and focuses on general metadata about the datasets
      (mostly using Dublin Core), and on different ways of
      distributing and accessing the dataset, including availability
      of the dataset in multiple formats. Combining terms from both
      DCAT and the Discovery Vocabulary can be useful for a number of
      reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Describing collections (catalogs) of research datasets</li>
        <li>Providing additional information about physical aspects (file size, file formats) of research data files</li>
        <li>Providing information about the data collection that produced the datasets in a data catalog</li>
        <li>Providing information about the logical structure (variables, concepts, etc.) of tabular datasets in a data catalog</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">Data Cube
      vocabulary</a> is a W3C standard for representing data cubes,
      that is, multidimensional aggregate data. Data cubes are often
      generated by tabulating or aggregating record-level datasets.
      For example, if an observation in a census data cube indicates
      the population of a certain age group in a certain region is
      12345, then this fact was obtained by aggregating that number of
      individual records from a record-level (or “microdata”) dataset.
      The Discovery Vocabulary contains a property “aggregation” that
      indicates that a Cube dataset was derived by tabulating a
      record-level dataset.</p>

      <p>Data Cube provides for the description of the structure of 
      such cubes, but also for the representation of the cube data
      itself, that is, the observations that make up the cube dataset.
      This is not the case for the the Discovery Vocabulary, which
      only describes the structure of a dataset, but is not concerned
      with representing the actual data in it. The actual data is
      assumed to sit in a data file (e.g., a CSV file, or in a
      proprietary stats package file format) that is not represented
      in RDF.</p>

      <p>The use of formal statistical classifications is very common
      in research data sets—these are treated in our vocabulary as
      SKOS concepts, but in some cases those working with formal
      statistical classifications may desire more expressive
      capability than SKOS provides. To support such users, the DDI
      Alliance also publishes
      <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/xkos">XKOS</a>, a
      vocabulary which extends SKOS
      to allow for a more complete description of such
      classifications. While the use of XKOS is not required by this
      vocabulary, the two are designed to work in complementary fashion.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/overview.jpg" alt="Vocabulary overview">
      </div>

      <p>To understand the DDI Discovery Vocabulary, there are a few
      central classes, which can serve as entry points. The first of
      these is the Study class, A Study in our model represents the
      process by which a data set was generated or collected. Literal
      properties include information about the funding, organizational
      affiliation, abstract, title, version, and other such high-level
      information. In some cases, where data collection is cyclic or
      on-going, data sets may be relleased as a StudyGroup, where each
      cycle or "wave" of the data collection activity produces one or
      more data sets. This is typical for longitudinal studies, panel
      studies, and other types of "series" (to use the DDI term). In
      this case, a number of Study objects would be collected into a
      single StudyGroup.</p>
 
      <p>Data sets have two representations in our model: a logical
      representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
      and a physical representation, which is a distribuited file
      holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
      different ways, even if the ogical content is the same. In our
      model the LogicalDataSet represents the content of the file
      (its organization into a set of Variables). The LogicalDataSet
      is an extension of the dact:DataSet class. Physical, distributed
      files are represented by the class DataFile, which is itself an
      extension of the dcat:Distribution.</p>
 
      <p>When it comes to understanding the contents of the data set,
      this is done using the Variable class. Variables provide a
      definition of the column in a rectangular data files, and can
      associate it with a Concept, and a Question (the Question in the
      Questionnaire which was used to collect the data). Variables are
      related to a representation of some form, which may be aa set of
      codes and categories (a "codelist") or may be one of other
      normal data types (dateTime, numeric, textual, etc.) Codes and
      Categories are represented using SKOS concepts and concept
      schemes.</p>
 
      <p>Data is collected about a specific phenomenon, typically
      involving some target population, and focusing on the analysis
      of a particular type of subject. These are respectively
      represented by the Universe class and the AnalysisUnit class.
      If, for example, the adult population of Finland is being
      studied, the AnalysisUnit would be individuals pr persons.</p>

      <h2>A worked example</h2>

      <p>We have a sample of a survey which has been documented using
      DDI XML—the 1980 Argentine National Population and Housing
      Census. The version of this data we are using as our example is
      the one disseminated by <a href="http://www.ipums.org/">IPUMS</a>,
      which provides internationally harmonized census data, to make
      it more useful for cross-border research. Thus, this data set is
      produced by two organizations: The Argentine National Institute
      of Statistics and Censuses, and the Minnesota Population Center
      housed in the University of Minnesota.</p>

      <p>To give some idea of what is contained in the metadata set,
      we will use some screen shots from a portal which indexes the
      DDI files to facilitate searching, and reflects the contents in
      a fashion which is easy to view.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-overview.png">
      </div>

      <p>Figure 1 shows us the overview page for this study, giving us
      some basic information—data producers, title, year, country, and
      a link to the access policies. If we look at the right-hand
      panel, we see an outline of the metadata contents of the file,
      including information about the questionnaire used, sampling
      methodology, and data collection activities, as well as detailed
      information about the variables contained in the two data
      files.</p>

      <p>Not all of this information is useful in a data discovery
      scenario—sampling and data collection methodologies is not
      typically indexed for searches. Information about the
      questionnaire is, as is detailed information about the variables
      contained in the files. We will look more closely at the
      metadata of primary interest for our discovery scenario.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-access-policy.png" alt="Access policy">
      </div>

      <p>Figure 2 shows us the information about access policies,
      which typically is of interest to those searching for data.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-universe.png" alt="Coverage and universe">
      </div>

      <p>While the sampling methodology may not be of great interest
      for those searching for data, one field within this section is:
      the “universe”, that is, the population being studied. Figure 3
      gives us an example of this information.</p>

      <p>In some cases we may have a lot of information about the
      questionnaires used, and it is very common to search for data by
      the text of the question used to collect it. Sometimes there
      will be a PDF of a questionnaire, and sometimes question text
      may be linked to individual variables within a file. In this
      case, we have only a textual description of the set of forms
      used in the census (Figure 4).</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-questionnaires.png" alt="Questionnaires">
      </div>

      <p>Next we find some general information about the data files
      produced by this study (Figure 5.)</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-general-data-file-info.png" alt="General data set information">
      </div>

      <p>In Figure 6 we see the list of variables contained in the
      data file. For each of these we will also have a detailed view,
      showing the codes and categories used to encode the actual
      responses in the variables (Figure 7).</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-variable-list.png" alt="Variables list">
      </div>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-variable-detail.png" alt="Variable details">
      </div>

      <p>At the bottom of the screen showing the variable detail, we
      can see that the variable for roofing material is associated
      with a high-level concept, “Dwelling characteristics variables.”
      (Figure 8.)</p>

    <section>
	  <h3>DDI-RDF Identifiers</h3>
	  
	  <p>Every entity defined in DDI-RDF is an rdfs:resource. General metadata elements which can be used on every resource in a DDI-RDF description include:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		<li>skos:prefLabel (rdf:langString): the preferred label of this element</li>
		<li>disco:ddi2_1identifier (xsd:anyURI): the unique identifier in DDI 2.1</li>
		<li>disco:ddi2_5identifier (xsd:anyURI): the unique identifier in DDI 2.5</li>
		<li>disco:ddi3_0identifier (xsd:anyURI): the unique identifier in DDI 3.0</li>
		<li>disco:ddi3_1identifier (xsd:anyURI): the unique identifier in DDI 3.1</li>
		<li>disco:ddi3_2identifier (xsd:anyURI): the unique identifier in DDI 3.2</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Note that in RDF, the unique identifier of a resource is its URI. The identifier properties are only used for easing the linkage between DDI-RDF metadata and the original DDI files.</p>

	  <p>Furthermore, every element can be related to any foaf:document using dcterms:relation.</p>

		<h3>Versioning Information</h3>
		<p>Use of the owl:versionInfo property is recommended to indicate the version number and/or additional versioning text of entities.</p>

		<p>Any entity can have version information; however, the most typical cases are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Version of the metadata (e.g., DDI file or RDF file), where the subject is the URL of the file</li>
			<li>Version of the study (e.g., as a study goes through the life cycle from conception through data collection, etc.), where the subject is a disco:Study</li>

	    <h3>Coverage of Studies, Logical Datasets, and Data Files</h3>
		<p>Studies, logical datasets, and data files may have a spatial, temporal, and topical coverage. Unlike in DDI XML, there is no dedicated Coverage type in DDI-RDF. In contrast, spatial, temporal, and topical coverage are directly attached to the respective study, logical dataset, and datafile.</p>
		<p>For spatial coverage, dcterms:spatial is used, pointing to any geographic location:</p>
		<pre>
ex:study1 dcterms:spatial &lt;http://sws.geonames.org/2921044/&gt; .		
		</pre>
		<p>In this example, <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> is used to refer to a spatial region, in this case, the country Germany. Geonames provides URIs for continents, countries, regions, and cities, among others, and is therefore a possible option to use for describing spatial coverage.</p>
        <p>For temporal coverage, dcterms:temporal is used. A possible way to describe temporal coverage is the use of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">W3C time ontology</a>:</p>
		<pre>
ex:study1 dcterms:temporal [
  a time:Interval ;
  time:hasBeginning [ time:inXSDDateTime
    "2012-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime ];
  time:hasEnd [ time:inXSDDateTime
    "2012-01-31T23:59:59+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime ] ] .		
		</pre>
		<p>This example describes a study that has been conducted between January 1st and January 31st.</p>
		<p>Topical coverage can be expressed using dcterms:subject. DDI-RDF foresees the use skos:Concept for the description of topical coverage:</p>
		<pre>
ex:study1 dcterms:subject [
  a skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "Alcohol consumption" ] .
		</pre>
		</section>

			<h3>Other General Dublin Core Metadata Properties</h3>
			<p>The following elements from Dublin Core may be used to describe general metadata of DDI-RDF elements (see the DC definitions for more detailed descriptions):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>dcterms:abstract (used with disco:Study): an abstract of the study</li>
				<li>dcterms:alternative (used with disco:Study): an alternative name for the study</li>
				<li>dcterms:available (used with disco:Study): the date (or date range) at which this study has or will become available</li>
				<li>dcterms:title (used with disco:Study, disco:LogicalDataSet): the element’s title</li>
				<li>dcterms:description (used with disco:DataElement, disco:DataFile, disco:Instrument, disco:Variable, dcterms:RightsStatement): a human readable description of the element</li>
				<li>dcterms:provenance (used with disco:DataFile): defines the provenance information for the data file. The object is a dcterms:ProvenanceStatement.</li>
			</ul>

      </div>

    <section>
      <h3>LogicalDataSet</h3>

      <p>LogicalDataSet represents the microdata dataset. You can
      state a title (dcterms:title) and a flag indicating if the
      microdata dataset is publicly available (isPublic). You can
      specify access rights (dcterms:accessRights) and license
      statements (dcterms:license) for microdata datasets.
      Dcterms:LicenseDocuments, which are also
      dcterms:RightsStatements, define license statements. You can
      describe and label access rights, represented by
      dcterms:RightsStatements. Further information about access
      rights and license statements can be retrieved from documents
      (rdfs:seeAlso).</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/logical-data-set.jpg" alt="LogicalDataSet">
      </div>

      <p>Microdata datasets may have associations to multiple
      instruments (instrument), to 1 coverage (coverage), to 1
      universe (dataSetUniverse), to multiple variables
      (containsVariable), to more than 1 DataSet (dataCube), to
      multiple data files (dataFile), and to exactly 1 coverage
      (coverage). The class DataSet is defined in the RDF Data Cube
      Vocabulary and may point to multiple variables
      (inputVariable).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>DataFile</h3>

      <p>The class DataFile, which is also a dcterms:Dataset,
      represents all the data files containing the microdata datasets.
      You can describe data files (dcterms:description) and you can
      specify data files’ case quantities, provenance information, and
      versions. You can further define the data files’ format
      (dcterms:format) using the datatype properties of
      dcterms:MediaTypeOrExtent or skos:Concept.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>DescriptiveStatistics</h3>

      <p>SummaryStatistics pointing to variables and
      CategoryStatistics pointing to categories and codes are both
      descriptive statistics. You can state maximum, minimum values,
      standard deviations, etc. for summary statistics. You can give
      frequencies, percentages, weighted percentages, etc. for
      category statistics. Descriptive statistics can also have
      DataFile as range (statisticsDataFile) to assign both summary
      statistics and category statistics to data files.</p>

      <h3>skos:Concept</h3>

      <p>We reuse skos:Concept to a large extent to represent DDI
      concepts, codes, and categories (see next figure). You can
      describe DDI concepts (skos:definition) and you can define
      hierarchies of DDI concepts (skos:broader and skos:narrower).
      You can describe code values (skos:notation) and category labels
      (skos:prefLabel).</p>

      <h3>Representation</h3>

      <p>Questions (object property responseDomain), variables
      (representation), and data elements (representation) may have
      representations. We defined the class Representation as union of
      individuals of the classes rdfs:Datatype (e.g. numeric or
      textual values) and skos:ConceptScheme, as for example questions
      may have as response domain a mixture of a numeric response
      domain containing numeric values (rdfs:Datatype) and a code
      response domain (skos:ConceptScheme). Skos:ConceptScheme
      (representing code schemes) may contain skos:Concepts
      (representing codes) using the object property skos:inScheme.</p>

      <h3>Instrument</h3>

      <p>You can describe (dcterms:description) and associate labels
      (skos:prefLabel) to instruments. Instruments may have external
      documentations. Questionnaires are special instruments having at
      least 1 collection mode, which is a skos:Concept, and including
      at least 1 question.</p>

      concepts (concept), and at least 1 response domain
      (responseDomain).</p>
