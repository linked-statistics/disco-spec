      <h3>Scope and Purpose</h3>

      <p>This specification is designed to support the discovery of
      microdata sets and related metadata using RDF technologies in the
      Web of Linked Data. Many archives and other organizations have
      large amounts of data, sometimes publically available, but often
      confidential in nature, requiring applications for access. Many
      such organizations use the
      <a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/what">Data Documentation Initiative</a>
      standard, which is a proven and highly detailed XML metadata
      format for describing rectangular data sets of this type.
      This vocabulary leverages the DDI specification to create a
      simplified version of this model for the discovery of data files.</p>

      <p>The data holdings of data archives are often collected by
      researchers, and only afterwards disseminated by archives. Other
      data-producing organizations such as research centers and
      statistical agencies are also increasingly interested in the
      DDI standards for documenting their own micro-data. In general
      terms, most DDI metadata describes data sets for the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences. This data is fairly
      consistent in format, consisting of rectangular data files with
      columns containing variables for a set of cases, contained in
      the rows. It is often collected by survey, although in some
      cases may come from administrative sources, sensors, or
      registers.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is intended not only for use by the research
      data community, but also by any others needing an RDF vocabulary
      for describing this type of rectangular data. This vocabulary
      will provide a useful model for describing some of the data sets
      now being published by open government initiatives, by providing
      a rich metadata structure for them. While the data sets may be
      available (typically as CSV files) the metadata which
      accompanies them is not necessarily coherent, making the
      discovery of these data sets difficult. This vocabulary would
      help to overcome this difficulty by allowing for the creation of
      standard queries to programmatically identify data sets, whether
      made available by government or held within a data archive.</p>
      
      <p>The document [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Scenarios">Scenarios</a></cite>] by Vompras, Gregory, Bosch, Capadisli, and Wackerow describes typical use cases for the applicability of the DDI-RDF Discovery vocabulary. In the Section <a class="bibref" href="#example-queries">Example Queries</a> of the Appendix additional discovery use cases are illustrated by several SPARQL queries.</p>

      <h3>About DDI</h3>

      <p>The Data Documentation Initiative standards are produced and
      maintained by a member-based consortium of global scope, the
      <a href="http://www.ddi-alliance.org/">DDI Alliance</a>. Housed
      currently at the
      <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/">Interuniversity Consortium
      for Political and Social Research</a> (ICPSR) at the University
      of Michigan, there are currently more than 30 member
      institutions. The standards have been under development for more
      than ten years, and are in widespread use among data archives
      and libraries, producers of research data, secure data centers,
      and statistical agencies.</p>

      <p>There are two major versions of DDI: the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">codebook</a>”
      version, which is an XML format for holding general information
      about a study, along with its data dictionary; and the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Lifecycle/">Lifecycle</a>”
      version of DDI, which allows for the description of more complex
      multi-wave studies, throughout the data lifecycle, from study 
      conception through data collection and processing.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is not specific to either of these versions,
      but represents the major types of metadata they contain in a
      highly simplified form, for the purposes of discovery. The XML
      Codebook and Lifecycle versions of DDI are very broad: these
      standards contain hundreds of metadata elements, providing
      enough information to programmatically work with the data files
      for such functions as the automatic creation of databases, and
      transformations between statistical packages. DDI in both
      versions is generally used to describe data found in ASCII
      files, whether positional files with fixed-width fields or files
      using a delimited format such as CSV.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to claim that there is a single agreed
      conceptual model for describing research data in the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences—there is a wide range of
      models and terms. However, the issues faced in this area have
      been the subject of discussion within the DDI community for many
      years, and the DDI model represents the best consensus which
      exists today. As such, it gives us a good basis for creating a
      vocabulary which will be recognizable to researchers familiar
      with this type of data.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Relationship to Data Cube, DCAT and XKOS</h2>

      <p>The Discovery Vocabulary is aligned to several other metadata
      vocabularies used in the RDF community.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">Data Catalog
      Vocabulary</a> (DCAT) is a W3C standard for describing catalogs
      of datasets, and we map to it in two places:
      Our <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code> is a subclass of DCAT’s Dataset, and our
      <code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code> is a subclass of DCAT’s Distribution. DCAT makes few
      assumptions about the kind of datasets being described,
      and focuses on general metadata about the datasets
      (mostly using Dublin Core), and on different ways of
      distributing and accessing the dataset, including availability
      of the dataset in multiple formats. Combining terms from both
      DCAT and the Discovery Vocabulary can be useful for a number of
      reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Describing collections (catalogs) of research datasets</li>
        <li>Providing additional information about physical aspects (file size, file formats) of research data files</li>
        <li>Providing information about the data collection that produced the datasets in a data catalog</li>
        <li>Providing information about the logical structure (variables, concepts, etc.) of tabular datasets in a data catalog</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">Data Cube
      vocabulary</a> is a W3C standard for representing data cubes,
      that is, multidimensional aggregate data. Data cubes are often
      generated by tabulating or aggregating record-level datasets.
      For example, if an observation in a census data cube indicates
      the population of a certain age group in a certain region is
      12345, then this fact was obtained by aggregating that number of
      individual records from a record-level (or “microdata”) dataset.
      The Discovery Vocabulary contains a property “aggregation” that
      indicates that a Cube dataset was derived by tabulating a
      record-level dataset.</p>

      <p>Data Cube provides for the description of the structure of 
      such cubes, but also for the representation of the cube data
      itself, that is, the observations that make up the cube dataset.
      This is not the case for the the Discovery Vocabulary, which
      only describes the structure of a dataset, but is not concerned
      with representing the actual data in it. The actual data is
      assumed to sit in a data file (e.g., a CSV file, or in a
      proprietary stats package file format) that is not represented
      in RDF.</p>

      <p>The use of formal statistical classifications is very common
      in research data sets—these are treated in our vocabulary as
      SKOS concepts, but in some cases those working with formal
      statistical classifications may desire more expressive
      capability than SKOS provides. To support such users, the DDI
      Alliance also publishes
      <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/xkos">XKOS</a>, a
      vocabulary which extends SKOS
      to allow for a more complete description of such
      classifications. While the use of XKOS is not required by this
      vocabulary, the two are designed to work in complementary fashion.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/overview.jpg" alt="Vocabulary overview"/>
      </div>

      <p>To understand the DDI Discovery Vocabulary, there are a few
      central classes, which can serve as entry points. The first of
      these is the <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> class. A <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code></b> in our model represents the
      process by which a data set was generated or collected. Literal
      properties include information about the funding, organizational
      affiliation, abstract, title, version, and other such high-level
      information. In some cases, where data collection is cyclic or
      on-going, data sets may be released as a <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">StudyGroup</a></code> </b>, where each
      cycle or "wave" of the data collection activity produces one or
      more data sets. This is typical for longitudinal studies, panel
      studies, and other types of "series" (to use the DDI term). In
      this case, a number of <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> objects would be collected into a
      single <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">StudyGroup</a></code>.</p>
 
      <p>Data sets have two representations in our model: a logical
      representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
      and a physical representation, which is a distributed file
      holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
      different ways, even if the logical content is the same. In our
      model the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code></b> represents the content of the file
      (its organization into a set of <code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variables</a></code>). The <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code>
      is an extension of the <code>dact:DataSet</code> class. Physical, distributed
      files are represented by the class <b> <code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code></b> (not depicted in the diagram), which is itself an
      extension of the <code>dcat:Distribution</code>.</p>
 
      <p>When it comes to understanding the contents of the data set,
      this is done using the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code></b> class. <code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variables</a></code> provide a
      definition of the column in a rectangular data file, and can
      associate it with a Concept, and a <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-question" class="internalDFN">Question</a></code></b> (the <code><a href="#dfn-disco-question" class="internalDFN">Question</a></code> in the
      <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-questionnaire" class="internalDFN">Questionnaire</a></code></b> which was used to collect the data). <code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variables</a></code> are
      related to a representation of some form, which may be a set of
      codes and categories (a "codelist") or may be one of other
      normal data types (dateTime, numeric, textual, etc.) Codes and
      Categories are represented using SKOS concepts and concept
      schemes.</p>
 
      <p>Data is collected about a specific phenomenon, typically
      involving some target population, and focusing on the analysis
      of a particular type of subject. These are respectively
      represented by the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-universe" class="internalDFN">Universe</a></code></b> class and the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-analysisunit" class="internalDFN">AnalysisUnit</a></code></b> class.
      If, for example, the adult population of Finland is being
      studied, the <code><a href="#dfn-disco-analysisunit" class="internalDFN">AnalysisUnit</a></code>
 would be individuals or persons.
      Bosch, Cyganiak, Wackerow, and Zapilko give a detailed overview of
 the DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary in a full paper written for the Dublin
 Core conference [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Linked-Statistical-Data">Linked-Statistical-Data</a></cite>].

      <h2>A Worked Example</h2>

      <p>We have a sample of a survey which has been documented using
      DDI XML—the 1980 Argentine National Population and Housing
      Census. The version of this data we are using as our example is
      the one disseminated by <a href="http://www.ipums.org/">IPUMS</a>,
      which provides internationally harmonized census data, to make
      it more useful for cross-border research. Thus, this data set is
      produced by two organizations: The Argentine National Institute
      of Statistics and Censuses, and the Minnesota Population Center
      housed in the University of Minnesota.</p>

      <p>To give some idea of what is contained in the metadata set,
      we will use some screen shots from OpenMetadata Survey Catalog, 
      a portal which indexes the
      DDI files to facilitate searching, and reflects the contents in
      a fashion which is easy to view. Follow this 
      <a href="http://www.openmetadata.org/surveycatalog/index.php/catalog/996">link</a>
       for the information about this DDI file at the OpenMetadata Survey Catalog.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-overview.png" alt="overview"/>
      </div>

      <p>Figure 2 shows us the overview page for this study, giving us
      some basic information - title, an identifier for the study, data producers, year, country, and
      a link to the access policies. If we look at the right-hand
      panel, we see an outline of the metadata contents of the file,
      including information about the questionnaire used, sampling
      methodology, and data collection activities, as well as detailed
      information about the variables contained in the two data
      files.</p>

      <p>Not all of this information is useful in a data discovery
      scenario—sampling and data collection methodologies is not
      typically indexed for searches. Information about the
      questionnaire is, as is detailed information about the variables
      contained in the files. We will look more closely at the
      metadata of primary interest for our discovery scenario.</p>
      
      Using RDF and the DDI Discovery Vocabulary, the study can also be described in triples:
      
      An instance of type <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> is given the title and the identifier; also, the two 
      data producers are linked and further described.
      
      The year and country are described in the form of a temporal and spatial coverage of the study. 
      Also, the topics of the study are represented.
	  
	  The study instance further contains an abstract.
	  
	  Since a study is an versionable object in DDI, we attach a version to it.
	  
	  A study further is described using various additional information, described further below.

      <p>While the sampling methodology may not be of great interest
        for those searching for data, one field within this section is:
        the “universe”, that is, the population being studied. Figure 3
        gives us an example of this information.</p>

	Using a type of instrument - a questionnaire -, the study produced a dataset. The dataset has access rights. 
	
	The dataset has a concrete data file that will populate certain variables.

	Any variable definition has a representation defining the possible values of a variable. 
	
	Also, a variable definition has its own universe (possibly the same as the study, possibly a 
	narrower one) and (DDI) concepts further describing the variable.

	Any universe of a variable definition is a subset of the universe of the entire study.

      <h2>Studies and StudyGroups</h2>

	  <p>A simple <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code></b> supports the stages of the full data lifecycle 
	  in a modular manner. A <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> represents the
      process by which a data set was generated or collected. Literal
      properties include information about the funding, organizational
      affiliation, abstract, title, version, and other such high-level
      information. The key criteria for a study are: 
	  a single conceptual model (e.g. survey research concept), 
	  a single instrument (e.g. questionnaire) made up of one or more parts 
	  (ex. employer survey, worker survey), and a single logical data structure 
	  of the initial raw data (multiple data files can be created from this such 
	  as a public use microdata file or aggregate data files).
	  In some cases, where data collection is cyclic or
      on-going, data sets may be released as a <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-studygroup" class="internalDFN">StudyGroup</a></code></b>, where each
      cycle or "wave" of the data collection activity produces one or
      more data sets. This is typical for longitudinal studies, panel
      studies, and other types of "series" (to use the DDI term). In
      this case, a number of <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> objects would be collected into a

    <section>
	  <h3>DDI-XML Identifiers and Relations to DDI-XML Files</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    Every entity defined in DDI-RDF is an <code>rdfs:Resource</code>. 
	    General metadata elements which can be used on every resource in a DDI-RDF description include:
      </p>
	  
	  <ul>
		<li><code>skos:prefLabel</code> (<code>rdf:langString</code>): the preferred label of this element</li>
		<li><code><a href="#dfn-disco-ddi2_1identifier" class="internalDFN">ddi2_1identifier</a></code> (<code>xsd:anyURI</code>): the unique identifier in DDI 2.1</li>
		<li><code><a href="#dfn-disco-ddi2_5identifier" class="internalDFN">ddi2_5identifier</a></code> (<code>xsd:anyURI</code>): the unique identifier in DDI 2.5</li>
		<li><code><a href="#dfn-disco-ddi3_0identifier" class="internalDFN">ddi3_0identifier</a></code> (<code>xsd:anyURI</code>): the unique identifier in DDI 3.0</li>
		<li><code><a href="#dfn-disco-ddi3_1identifier" class="internalDFN">ddi3_1identifier</a></code> (<code>xsd:anyURI</code>): the unique identifier in DDI 3.1</li>
		<li><code><a href="#dfn-disco-dd32_2identifier" class="internalDFN">ddi3_2identifier</a></code> (<code>xsd:anyURI</code>): the unique identifier in DDI 3.2</li>
		
	  </ul>

	  <p>Note that in RDF, the unique identifier of a resource is its URI. The identifier properties are only used for easing the linkage between DDI-RDF metadata and the original DDI files.</p>

	  <p>
	    Furthermore, every element can be related to any <code>foaf:Document</code> using <code>dcterms:relation</code>.
		The cardinalities are in both directions 0 to n.

	  <section>
		<h3>Versioning Information</h3>
		<p>Use of the <code>owl:versionInfo</code> property is recommended to indicate the version number and/or additional versioning text of entities.</p>

		<p>Any entity can have version information; however, the most typical cases are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Version of the metadata (e.g., DDI file or RDF file), where the subject is the URL of the file</li>
			<li>Version of the study (e.g., as a study goes through the life cycle from conception through data collection, etc.), where the subject is a <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code></li>
			<li>Version of the data files, where the subject is a <code><a href="#dfn-disco-dataFile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code>.</li>
		</ul>

	  <section>
	  <h3>Access Rights Statements and Licenses</h3>
	  <p>Every logical dataset may have access rights statements and licensing information attached to it. For those purposes, the dublin core properties <code>dcterms:accessRights</code> and <code>dcterms:license</code> are used.</p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Access rights are defined in a <b><code>dcterms:RightsStatement</code></b> object, 
		which may reference an external document stating the access rights in more detail (<code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>).
		For <code>dcterms:RightsStatements</code> descriptions (<code>dcterms:description</code>) and labels (<code>skos:prefLabel</code>) can be assigned: 
	  </p>
	    <pre class="example">
ex:dataset1 a disco:LogicalDataset ;
  dcterms:accessRights ex:accessRights1 .
ex:accessRights1 dcterms:description "Everybody may see access this document." ;
  rdfs:seeAlso &lt;http://www.example.org/access.html&gt; . 
	  </pre>
	  <p>License information is captured in a <b><code>dcterms:LicenseDocument</code></b>, which is a subtype of <code>dcterms:RightsStatements</code>:</p>
	    <pre class="example">
ex:dataset1 a disco:LogicalDataset ;
  dcterms:license ex:license1 .
ex:license1 dcterms:description "Published under Open Content License." ;
  skos:prefLabel "OCL 1.0" ;
  rdfs:seeAlso &lt;http://opencontent.org/opl.shtml&gt; .	  
	  </pre>
	  
	  <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/access-rights-statements-and-licenses.jpg" alt="Access Rights Statements and Licenses"/>
      </div>
	  
	  <p>
	    <code><a href="#dfn-disco-LogicalDataSet" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSets</a></code> may have <code>dcterms:accessRights</code> relationships to <code>dcterms:RightsStatements</code>
		and <code>dcterms:license</code> connections with <code>dcterms:LicenseDocument</code>.
		<code>dcterms:RightsStatements</code> is associated with <code>foaf:Documents</code> using the object property <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>. 
		The multiplicities for these object properties are in any case 0 to n.
	  </p>
	  
	  </section>
	  
	  <section>
	    <h3>Coverage of Studies, Logical Datasets, and Data Files</h3>
		<p>Coverage comprehends the key features of the scope of the data (e.g. geographic product occupation). <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Studies</a></code>, logical datasets, and data files may have a spatial, temporal, and topical coverage. Unlike in DDI-XML, there is no dedicated Coverage type in DDI-RDF. In contrast, spatial, temporal, and topical coverage are directly attached to the respective study, logical dataset, and datafile.</p>
		<p>For spatial coverage, <b><code>dcterms:spatial</code></b> is used, pointing to any geographic location (<code>dcterms:Location</code>):</p>
	    <pre class="example">
ex:study1 dcterms:spatial &lt;http://sws.geonames.org/2921044/&gt; .		
		</pre>
		<p>In this example, <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> is used to refer to a spatial region, in this case, the country Germany. Geonames provides URIs for continents, countries, regions, and cities, among others, and is therefore a possible option to use for describing spatial coverage.</p>
        
		<div class="figure">
          <img src="diagrams/study-coverage.jpg" alt="Study Coverage"/>
        </div>
		
		<p>
		  For temporal coverage, <b><code>dcterms:temporal</code></b> is used pointing to <code>dcterms:PeriodOfTime</code>.
          For time periods, labels can be attachted ( <code>skos:prefLabel</code>). It is also possible to define 
		  start (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-startDate" class="internalDFN">startDate</a></code>) and end dates (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-endDate" class="internalDFN">endDate</a></code>).  
		  
		  A possible way to describe temporal coverage is the use of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">W3C time ontology</a>:
		</p>
		
	    <pre class="example">
ex:study1 dcterms:temporal [
  a time:Interval ;
  time:hasBeginning [ time:inXSDDateTime
    "2012-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime ];
  time:hasEnd [ time:inXSDDateTime
    "2012-01-31T23:59:59+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime ] ] .		
		</pre>
		<p>This example describes a study that has been conducted between January 1st and January 31st.</p>
		
		<div class="figure">
          <img src="diagrams/logical-data-set-coverage.jpg" alt="LogicalDataSet Coverage"/>
        </div>
		
		<p>Topical coverage can be expressed using <b><code>dcterms:subject</code></b>. DDI-RDF foresees the use <code>skos:Concept</code> for the description of topical coverage:</p>
	    <pre class="example">
ex:study1 dcterms:subject [
  a skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "Alcohol consumption" ] .
		</pre>
		
		<div class="figure">
          <img src="diagrams/data-file-coverage.jpg" alt="DataFile Coverage"/>
        </div>
		
		<p>
		  The multiplicities for each of the three object properties <code>dcterms:subject</code>, <code>dcterms:temporal</code>, and <code>dcterms:spatial</code> are in any case 0 to n.
		</p>
		
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Other General Dublin Core Metadata Properties</h3>
			<p>The following elements from Dublin Core may be used to describe general metadata of DDI-RDF elements (see the DC definitions for more detailed descriptions):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>dcterms:abstract</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>): an abstract of the study</li>
				<li><code>dcterms:alternativet</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>): an alternative name for the study</li>
				<li><code>dcterms:available</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>): the date (or date range) at which this study has or will become available</li>
				<li><code>dcterms:title</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>, <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicalDataSet" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code>): the element’s title</li>
				<li><code>dcterms:description</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-dataElement" class="internalDFN">DataElement</a></code>DataElement, <code><a href="#dfn-disco-dataFile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code>, <code><a href="#dfn-disco-instrument" class="internalDFN">Instrument</a></code>, <code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code>, <code>dcterms:RightsStatement</code>): a human readable description of the element</li>
				<li><code>dcterms:provenance</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-dataFile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code>): defines the provenance information for the data file. The object is a <code>dcterms:ProvenanceStatement</code>.</li>

      <h2>Data Sets, Data Files, and Descriptive Statistics</h2>

	  <p>Data sets have two representations in our model: a logical
      representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
      and a physical representation, which is a distribuited file
      holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
      different ways, even if the logical content is the same. In our
      model the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicalDataSet" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code></b> represents the content of the file
      (its organization into a set of <code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variables</a></code>). The <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicalDataSet" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code>
      is an extension of the <code>dact:DataSet</code> class. Physical, distributed
      files are represented by the class <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-dataFile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code></b>, which is itself an
      extension of the <code>dcat:Distribution</code>. <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-descriptiveStatistics" class="internalDFN">DescriptiveStatistics</a></code></b>

      <h3>DescriptiveStatistics</h3>

      <p>

		an approach to map the SDMX information model to an ontology. A <code><a href="#dfn-disco-dataSet" class="internalDFN">DataSet</a></code> represents aggregated data 
		(also known as macrodata) such as multi-dimensional tables. Aggregated data are derived from microdata 
		by statistics on groups, or aggregates such as counts, means, or frequencies.
	    <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-summaryStatistics" class="internalDFN">SummaryStatistics</a></code></b> pointing to variables and
        <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-categoryStatistics" class="internalDFN">CategoryStatistics</a></code></b> pointing to categories and codes are both
        descriptive statistics.

      <h3>skos:Concept and skos:ConceptScheme</h3>

	  <p>
	    SKOS defines the term <b><code>skos:Concept</code></b>, which is a unit of knowledge created by a unique 
		combination of characteristics. In context of statistical (meta)data, concepts 
		are abstract summaries, general notions, knowledge of a whole set of behaviours, 
		attitudes or characteristics which are seen as having something in common. 
		Concepts may be associated with variables and questions. 
		A <b><code>skos:ConceptScheme</code></b>, also defined within the SKOS namespace, is a set of metadata 
		describing statistical concepts. 
		<code>Skos:Concept</code> is reused to a large extent to represent DDI concepts, codes, and categories.
	  </p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/concept.jpg" alt="skos:Concept and skos:ConceptScheme"/>
      </div>
	  
	  <p>
		DDI concepts can be described using <code>skos:definition</code>.
		Furthermore, you can describe code values (<code>skos:notation</code>) and category labels
        (<code>skos:prefLabel</code>).
        Hierarchies of DDI concepts can be built using the object properties <code>skos:broader</code> and <code>skos:narrower</code>.
		The domains and the ranges of <code>skos:broader</code> and <code>skos:narrower</code> are <code>skos:Concept</code>.
        The cardinalities are in both directions 0 to n.
        <code>Skos:Concept</code> may be organized in 0 to n <code>skos:ConceptSchemes</code> by means of <code>skos:inScheme</code>.
        <code>skos:ConceptSchemes</code> may have multiple (0 - n) <code>skos:Concept</code> as parts.
        The top concept in a specific ConceptScheme is indicated by <code>skos:hasTopConcept</code> pointing 
		to 0 to n top <code>skos:Concept</code>. A specific <code>skos:Concept</code> may be the top concept to multiple
        (0 - n) <code>skos:ConceptSchemes</code>.

      <h3>Representation</h3>

	  <p>
	    The <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-representation" class="internalDFN">Representation</a></code></b> of a variable is the combination of a value domain, 
		datatype, and, if necessary, a unit of measure or a character set. 
		<code><a href="#dfn-disco-representation" class="internalDFN">Representation</a></code> is one of a set of values to which a numerical measure or a category 
		from a classification can be assigned (e.g. income, age, and sex: male coded as 1). 
		<code><a href="#dfn-disco-question" class="internalDFN">Questions</a></code> (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-responseDomain" class="internalDFN">responseDomain</a></code>), <code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variables</a></code>
        (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-representation" class="internalDFN">Representation</a></code>), and <code><a href="#dfn-disco-variableDefinition" class="internalDFN">VariableDefinitions</a></code> (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-representation" class="internalDFN">Representation</a></code>) may have
        representations.
		<code><a href="#dfn-disco-representation" class="internalDFN">Representation</a></code> is defined as sub-class of the union of <b><code>rdfs:Datatype</code></b> (e.g. numeric or
        textual values) and <b><code>skos:ConceptScheme</code></b>, as for example questions
        may have as response domain a mixture of a numeric response
        domain containing numeric values (<code>rdfs:Datatype</code>) and a code
        response domain (<code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>).

	  <p>
	      Vompras, Gregory, Bosch, Capadisli, and Wackerow [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Scenarios">Scenarios</a></cite>] have written a paper describing typical use cases associated with the DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary. 
	      The specification the DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary does not contain the full list of all the possible use cases. The complete list can be found in the mentioned paper.
	      We now show a couple of representative use cases associated with the DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary.
