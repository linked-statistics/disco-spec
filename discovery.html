      <h3>Scope and Purpose</h3>

      <p>This specification is designed to support the discovery of
      microdata sets and related metadata using RDF technologies in the
      Web of Linked Data. Many archives and other organizations have
      large amounts of data, sometimes publically available, but often
      confidential in nature, requiring applications for access. Many
      such organizations use the
      <a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/what">Data Documentation Initiative</a>
      standard, which is a proven and highly detailed XML metadata
      format for describing rectangular data sets of this type.
      This vocabulary makes use of the DDI specification to create a
      simplified version of this model for the discovery of data files.</p>

      <p>The data holdings of data archives are often collected by
      researchers, and only afterwards disseminated by archives. Other
      data-producing organizations such as research centers and
      statistical agencies are also increasingly interested in the
      DDI standards for documenting their own micro-data. In general
      terms, most DDI metadata describes data sets for the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences. This data is fairly
      consistent in format, consisting of rectangular data files with
      columns containing variables for a set of cases, contained in
      the rows. It is often collected by survey, although in some
      cases may come from administrative sources, sensors, or
      registers.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is intended not only for use by the research
      data community, but also by any others needing an RDF vocabulary
      for describing this type of rectangular data. This vocabulary
      will provide a useful model for describing some of the data sets
      now being published by open government initiatives, by providing
      a rich metadata structure for them. While the data sets may be
      available (typically as CSV files) the metadata which
      accompanies them is not necessarily coherent, making the
      discovery of these data sets difficult. This vocabulary would
      help to overcome this difficulty by allowing for the creation of
      standard queries to programmatically identify data sets, whether
      made available by government or held within a data archive.</p>
	  
	  <p>
		Disco could be used to discover datasets by searching for specific questions, topics, and geographical coverage.
		The document [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Scenarios">Scenarios</a></cite>] by Vompras, Gregory, Bosch, Capadisli, and Wackerow describes typical use cases for the applicability of the DDI-RDF Discovery vocabulary. In the Section <a class="bibref" href="#example-queries">Use Cases and Example Queries</a> of the Appendix additional discovery use cases are illustrated by several SPARQL queries.</p>
    </section>

	  <p>
	    Statistical domain experts (core members of the DDI Alliance Technical Implementation Committee, 
		representatives of national statistical institutes, national data archives) and Linked Open Data community 
		members have selected the DDI elements which are seen as most important to solve problems associated with 
		use cases in the area of data discovery. This section gives an overview of the conceptual model. 
		More detailed descriptions of all the properties are given in the specification and two conference papers [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Linked-Statistical-Data">Linked-Statistical-Data</a></cite>] [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-DDI-RDF-Discovery-Vocabulary">DDI-RDF-Discovery-Vocabulary</a></cite>]. 
		Disco is intended to provide means to describe microdata by essential metadata for the discovery purpose. 
		Existing DDI-XML instances can be transformed into this RDF format and therefore exposed in the Web of Linked Data. 
		The vice-versa process is not intended, as we have defined Disco components and reused components of other 
		RDF vocabularies which make only sense in the Linked Data field.

      <h3>About DDI</h3>

      <p>The Data Documentation Initiative standards are produced and
      maintained by a member-based consortium of global scope, the
      <a href="http://www.ddi-alliance.org/">DDI Alliance</a>. Housed
      currently at the
      <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/">Interuniversity Consortium
      for Political and Social Research</a> (ICPSR) at the University
      of Michigan, there are currently more than 30 member
      institutions. The standards have been under development for more
      than ten years, and are in widespread use among data archives
      and libraries, producers of research data, secure data centers,
      and statistical agencies.</p>

      <p>There are two major versions of DDI: the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">codebook</a>”
      version, which is an XML format for holding general information
      about a study, along with its data dictionary; and the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Lifecycle/">Lifecycle</a>”
      version of DDI, which allows for the description of more complex
      multi-wave studies, throughout the data lifecycle, from study 
      conception through data collection and processing.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is not specific to either of these versions,
      but represents the major types of metadata they contain in a
      highly simplified form, for the purposes of discovery. The XML
      Codebook and Lifecycle versions of DDI are very broad: these
      standards contain hundreds of metadata elements, providing
      enough information to programmatically work with the data files
      for such functions as the automatic creation of databases, and
      transformations between statistical packages. DDI in both
      versions is generally used to describe data found in ASCII
      files, whether positional files with fixed-width fields or files
      using a delimited format such as CSV.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to claim that there is a single agreed
      conceptual model for describing research data in the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences—there is a wide range of
      models and terms. However, the issues faced in this area have
      been the subject of discussion within the DDI community for many
      years, and the DDI model represents the best consensus which
      exists today. As such, it gives us a good basis for creating a
      vocabulary which will be recognizable to researchers familiar
      with this type of data.</p>

      <h2>Relationship to Data Cube, DCAT and XKOS</h2>

      <p>The Discovery Vocabulary is aligned to several other metadata
      vocabularies used in the RDF community.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">Data Catalog
      Vocabulary</a> (DCAT) is a W3C standard for describing catalogs
      of datasets, and we map to it in two places:
      Our <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code> is a subclass of DCAT’s Dataset, and our
      <code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code> is a subclass of DCAT’s Distribution. DCAT makes few
      assumptions about the kind of datasets being described,
      and focuses on general metadata about the datasets
      (mostly using Dublin Core), and on different ways of
      distributing and accessing the dataset, including availability
      of the dataset in multiple formats. Combining terms from both
      DCAT and the Discovery Vocabulary can be useful for a number of
      reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Describing collections (catalogs) of research datasets (DCAT)</li>
        <li>Providing additional information about physical aspects (file size, file formats) of research data files (DCAT)</li>
        <li>Providing information about the data collection that produced the datasets in a data catalog (disco)</li>
        <li>Providing information about the logical structure (variables, concepts, etc.) of tabular datasets in a data catalog (disco)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">Data Cube
      vocabulary</a> is a W3C standard for representing data cubes,
      that is, multidimensional aggregate data. Data cubes are often
      generated by tabulating or aggregating record-level datasets.
      For example, if an observation in a census data cube indicates
      the population of a certain age group in a certain region is
      12345, then this fact was obtained by aggregating that number of
      individual records from a record-level (or “microdata”) dataset.
      The Discovery Vocabulary contains a property “aggregation” (pointing from a disco data set to a Data Cube dataset) that
      indicates that a Cube dataset was derived by tabulating a
      record-level dataset.</p>

      <p>Data Cube provides for the description of the structure of 
      such cubes, but also for the representation of the cube data
      itself, that is, the observations that make up the cube dataset.
      This is not the case for the Discovery Vocabulary, which
      only describes the structure of a dataset, but is not concerned
      with representing the actual data in it. The actual data is
      assumed to sit in a data file (e.g., a CSV file, or in a
      proprietary stats package file format) that is not represented
      in RDF.</p>
	  
	  <p>
	  The interplay of Data Cube and Disco needs further exploration regarding the relationship of aggregate data, 
	  aggregation methods, and the underlying microdata. 
	  The goal would be to drill down to the related microdata based on a search resulting in aggregate data. 
	  On the one hand aggregate data are often easily available and gives a quick overview. 
	  On the other hand microdata enable more detailed analyses.
	  </p>

      <p>The use of formal statistical classifications is very common
      in research data sets—these are treated in our vocabulary as
      SKOS concepts, but in some cases those working with formal
      statistical classifications may desire more expressive
      capability than SKOS provides. To support such users, the DDI
      Alliance also publishes
      <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/xkos">XKOS</a>, a
      vocabulary which extends SKOS
      to allow for a more complete description of such
      classifications. While the use of XKOS is not required by this
      vocabulary, the two are designed to work in complementary fashion.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <div class="figure">
        <img class="uml-diagram" src="diagrams/overview.png" alt="Vocabulary Overview"/>
      </div>

      <p>To understand the DDI Discovery Vocabulary, there are a few
      central classes, which can serve as entry points. The first of
      these is the <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> class. A <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code></b> in our model represents the
      process by which a data set was generated or collected. Literal
      properties include information about the funding, organizational
      affiliation, abstract, title, version, and other such high-level
      information. In some cases, where data collection is cyclic or
      on-going, data sets may be released as a <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-studygroup" class="internalDFN">StudyGroup</a></code></b>, where each
      cycle or "wave" of the data collection activity produces one or
      more data sets. This is typical for longitudinal studies, panel
      studies, and other types of "series" (to use the DDI term). In
      this case, a number of <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> objects would be collected into a
      single <code><a href="#dfn-disco-StudyGroup" class="internalDFN">StudyGroup</a></code>.</p>
 
      <p>Data sets have two representations in our model: a logical
      representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
      and a physical representation, which is a distributed file
      holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
      different ways, even if the logical content is the same. In our
      model the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code></b> represents the content of the file
      (its organization into a set of variables (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code>)). The <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code>
      is an extension of the <code>dact:DataSet</code> class. Physical, distributed
      files are represented by the class <b> <code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code></b> (not depicted in the diagram), which is itself an
      extension of the <code>dcat:Distribution</code>.</p>
 
      <p>When it comes to understanding the contents of the data set,
      this is done using the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code></b> class. Variables (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code>) provide a

      <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-questionnaire" class="internalDFN">Questionnaire</a></code></b> which was used to collect the data). Variables (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code>) are
      related to a representation of some form, which may be a set of
      codes and categories (a "codelist") or may be one of other

      Categories are represented using SKOS concepts and concept
      schemes.</p>
 
      <p>Data is collected about a specific phenomenon, typically
      involving some target population, and focusing on the analysis
      of a particular type of subject. These are respectively
      represented by the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-universe" class="internalDFN">Universe</a></code></b> class and the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-analysisunit" class="internalDFN">AnalysisUnit</a></code></b> class.
      If, for example, the adult population of Finland is being
      studied, the <code><a href="#dfn-disco-analysisunit" class="internalDFN">AnalysisUnit</a></code>
 would be individuals or persons.

      <h2>A Worked Example</h2>

      <p>We have a sample of a survey which has been documented using
      DDI XML—the 1980 Argentine National Population and Housing
      Census. The version of this data we are using as our example is
      the one disseminated by <a href="http://www.ipums.org/">IPUMS</a>,
      which provides internationally harmonized census data, to make
      it more useful for cross-border research. Thus, this data set is
      produced by two organizations: The Argentine National Institute
      of Statistics and Censuses, and the Minnesota Population Center
      housed in the University of Minnesota.</p>

      <p>To give some idea of what is contained in the metadata set,
      we will use some screen shots from OpenMetadata Survey Catalog, 
      a portal which indexes the
      DDI files to facilitate searching, and reflects the contents in
      a fashion which is easy to view. Follow this 
      <a href="http://www.openmetadata.org/surveycatalog/index.php/catalog/996">link</a>
       for the information about this DDI file at the OpenMetadata Survey Catalog.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-overview.png" alt="Overview"/>
      </div>

      <p>Figure 2 shows us the overview page for this study, giving us
      some basic information - title, an identifier for the study, data producers, year, country, and
      a link to the access policies. If we look at the right-hand
      panel, we see an outline of the metadata contents of the file,
      including information about the questionnaire used, sampling
      methodology, and data collection activities, as well as detailed
      information about the variables contained in the two data
      files.</p>

      <p>Not all of this information is useful in a data discovery
      scenario—sampling and data collection methodologies are not
      typically indexed for searches. Information about the
      questionnaire is, as is detailed information about the variables
      contained in the files. We will look more closely at the
      metadata of primary interest for our discovery scenario.</p>
      
      Using RDF and the DDI Discovery Vocabulary, the study can also be described in triples:
      
      An instance of type of <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> is given the title and the identifier; also, the two 
      data producers are linked and further described.
      
      The year and country are described in the form of a temporal and spatial coverage of the study. 
      Also, the topics of the study are represented.
	  
	  The study instance further contains an abstract.
	  
	  Since a study is a versionable object in DDI, we attach a version to it.
	  
	  A study is further described using additional information which is described further below.

	Using a type of instrument - a questionnaire -, the study produced a dataset. The dataset has access rights. 
	
	The dataset has a concrete data file that will populate certain variables.

      <h2>Studies and StudyGroups</h2>

	  <p>A simple <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code></b> supports the stages of the full data lifecycle 
	  in a modular manner. A <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> represents the
      process by which a data set was generated or collected. Literal
      properties include information about the funding, organizational
      affiliation, abstract, title, version, and other such high-level
      information. The key criteria for a study are: 
	  a single conceptual model (e.g. survey research concept), 
	  a single instrument (e.g. questionnaire) made up of one or more parts 
	  (ex. employer survey, worker survey), and a single logical data structure 
	  of the initial raw data (multiple data files can be created from this such 
	  as a public use microdata file or aggregate data files).
	  In some cases, where data collection is cyclic or
      on-going, data sets may be released as a <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-studygroup" class="internalDFN">StudyGroup</a></code></b>, where each
      cycle or "wave" of the data collection activity produces one or
      more data sets. This is typical for longitudinal studies, panel
      studies, and other types of "series" (to use the DDI term). In
      this case, a number of <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code> objects would be collected into a

		On the other hand, variables (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code>) must be related to 1 to n studies (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>).

	    Examples include survey data, census/enumeration data, administrative data, measurement data, assessment data, demographic data, voting data, etc.
	    You can use <code>dcterms:subject</code> to describe the topical coverage of studies (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>) and groups of studies (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-studygroup" class="internalDFN">StudyGroup</a></code>).

		objects about which information is to be sought. A survey population (also known
		as the coverage of the survey) is the population from which information can be 
		obtained in the survey. 

		<b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-analysisunit" class="internalDFN">AnalysisUnit</a></code></b> is defined as follows: The process collecting data is focusing

      <h2>General Metadata</h2>

      <section>
		  <h3>Identification</h3>
			
		    <p>In DDI, a lot of entities hold particular identifiers. This can be identifiers for different versions of DDI, but also persistent identifiers for, e.g. persons or organizations, that are encoded in a particular identifier scheme, e.g. ORCID or FundRef. In general, such identifiers can be added to each entitiy in DDI-RDF, since every entity is defined as an <code>rdfs:Resource</code>. 
	    General metadata elements which can be used on every resource in a DDI-RDF description include:
            </p>
	  
		  <ul>
			<li><code>skos:prefLabel</code> (<code>rdf:langString</code>): the preferred label of this element</li>
			<li><code>adms:identifier</code> (<code>rdfs:Resource</code>, <code>adms:Identifier</code>): the identifier of this element</li>
			
		  </ul>			
			<p>
			  Each Disco resource must have an identifier (see figure below). 
			  The identifier is stated using the object property adms:identifier pointing from any rdfs:Ressource to 1 to n idetifiers (adms:Identifier).
			  The class adms:Identifier can include the actual identifier itself and information on identifier scheme, its version, and its agency.
			  </p>
			
			<div class="figure">
			  <img class="uml-diagram" src="diagrams/identification-versioning.png" alt="Identification"/>
			</div>
			
		  <pre class="example">
&lt;#Study&gt; a disco:Study;
  dcterms:title "National Population and Housing Census, 1980"@en;
  adms:identifier [ a adms:Identifier;

		<h3>Versioning Information</h3>
		<p>Use of the <code>owl:versionInfo</code> property is recommended to indicate the version number and/or additional versioning text of entities.</p>
 
		<p>
		  Any entity can have version information. As you can see in the next UML class diagram, the property owl:versionInfo has rdfs:Resource as domain. 
          As a consequence, each DDI object can have attached versioning information.		  
		  However, the most typical cases are:</p>
 
		<ul>
			<li>Version of the metadata (e.g., DDI file or RDF file), where the subject is the URL of the file</li>
			<li>Version of the study (e.g., as a study goes through the life cycle from conception through data collection, etc.), where the subject is a <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code></li>
			<li>Version of the data files, where the subject is a <code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code>.</li>

		<h4>Relations to DDI-XML Files</h4>
		
		<p>
			Since the Discovery Vocabulary only covers a subset of an original DDI-XML file, it may be worthwile to have a relationship to the original DDI-XML file. Such a relationship can be represented using <code>dcterms:relation</code>. This way, every element can be related to any <code>foaf:Document</code>. The cardinalities are in both directions 0 to n.

	  </section>
	  
	  <section>
	  
		<h4>Relations Between Publications and Studies</h4>
		
		<p>
			So far, we can use the general property <code>dcterms:relation</code> for relations between publications and studies. 
			The domain of <code>dcterms:relation</code> is <code>rdfs:Resource</code> and the range is <code>foaf:Document</code>.
            Other kinds of relations could be primaryLiterature and secondaryLiterature.

	  <h3>Access Rights Statements and Licenses</h3>
	  <p>Every logical dataset may have access rights statements and licensing information attached to it. For those purposes, the Dublin Core properties <code>dcterms:accessRights</code> and <code>dcterms:license</code> are used.</p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Access rights are defined in a <b><code>dcterms:RightsStatement</code></b> object, 
		which may reference an external document stating the access rights in more detail (<code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>).
		For <code>dcterms:RightsStatements</code> descriptions (<code>dcterms:description</code>) and labels (<code>skos:prefLabel</code>) can be assigned: 
	  </p>
	    <pre class="example">
ex:Dataset1 a disco:LogicalDataset ;
  dcterms:accessRights ex:AccessRights1 .
ex:AccessRights1 dcterms:description "Everybody may see access this document." ;
  rdfs:seeAlso &lt;http://www.example.org/access.html&gt; . 
	  </pre>
	  <p>License information is captured in a <b><code>dcterms:LicenseDocument</code></b>, which is a subtype of <code>dcterms:RightsStatements</code>:</p>
	    <pre class="example">
ex:Dataset1 a disco:LogicalDataset ;
  dcterms:license ex:License1 .
ex:License1 dcterms:description "Published under Open Content License." ;

      </div>
	  
	  <p>
	    Logical data sets (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-LogicalDataSet" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code>) may have <code>dcterms:accessRights</code> relationships to <code>dcterms:RightsStatements</code>
		and <code>dcterms:license</code> connections with <code>dcterms:LicenseDocument</code>.
		<code>dcterms:RightsStatements</code> is associated with <code>foaf:Documents</code> using the object property <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>. 
		The multiplicities for these object properties are in any case 0 to n.

	  <section>
	    <h3>Coverage of Studies, Logical Datasets, and Data Files</h3>
		<p>Coverage comprehends the key features of the scope of the data (e.g. geographic product occupation). Studies (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>), logical datasets, and data files may have a spatial, temporal, and topical coverage. Unlike in DDI-XML, there is no dedicated Coverage type in DDI-RDF. In contrast, spatial, temporal, and topical coverage are directly attached to the respective study, logical dataset, and datafile.</p>
		<p>For spatial coverage, <b><code>dcterms:spatial</code></b> is used, pointing to any geographic location (<code>dcterms:Location</code>):</p>
	    <pre class="example">
ex:Study1 dcterms:spatial &lt;http://sws.geonames.org/2921044/&gt; .		
		</pre>
		<p>In this example, <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> is used to refer to a spatial region, in this case, the country Germany. Geonames provides URIs for continents, countries, regions, and cities, among others, and is therefore a possible option to use for describing spatial coverage.</p>
        
		<div class="figure">
          <img class="uml-diagram" src="diagrams/study-coverage.png" alt="Study Coverage"/>
        </div>
		
		<p>
		  For temporal coverage, <b><code>dcterms:temporal</code></b> is used pointing to <code>dcterms:PeriodOfTime</code>.
          For time periods, labels can be attachted ( <code>skos:prefLabel</code>). It is also possible to define 
		  start (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-startdate" class="internalDFN">startDate</a></code>) and end dates (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-enddate" class="internalDFN">endDate</a></code>).  
		  
		  A possible way to describe temporal coverage is the use of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">W3C time ontology</a>:
		</p>
		
	    <pre class="example">
ex:Study1 dcterms:temporal [
  a time:Interval ;
  time:hasBeginning [ time:inXSDDateTime
    "2012-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime ];
  time:hasEnd [ time:inXSDDateTime
    "2012-01-31T23:59:59+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime ] ] .		
		</pre>
		<p>This example describes a study that has been conducted between January 1st and January 31st.</p>
		
		<div class="figure">
          <img class="uml-diagram" src="diagrams/logical-data-set-coverage.png" alt="LogicalDataSet Coverage"/>
        </div>
		
		<p>Topical coverage can be expressed using <b><code>dcterms:subject</code></b>. DDI-RDF foresees the use <code>skos:Concept</code> for the description of topical coverage:</p>
	    <pre class="example">
ex:Study1 dcterms:subject [
  a skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "Alcohol consumption" ] .
		</pre>
		
		<div class="figure">
          <img class="uml-diagram" src="diagrams/data-file-coverage.png" alt="DataFile Coverage"/>
        </div>
		
		<p>
		  The multiplicities for each of the three object properties <code>dcterms:subject</code>, <code>dcterms:temporal</code>, and <code>dcterms:spatial</code> are in any case 0 to n.
		</p>
		
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Other General Dublin Core Metadata Properties</h3>
			<p>The following elements from Dublin Core may be used to describe general metadata of DDI-RDF elements (see the DC definitions for more detailed descriptions):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>dcterms:abstract</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>): an abstract of the study</li>
				<li><code>dcterms:alternativet</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>): an alternative name for the study</li>
				<li><code>dcterms:available</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>): the date (or date range) at which this study has or will become available</li>
				<li><code>dcterms:title</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-study" class="internalDFN">Study</a></code>, <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code>): the element’s title</li>

				<li><code>dcterms:provenance</code> (used with <code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code>): defines the provenance information for the data file. The object is a <code>dcterms:ProvenanceStatement</code>.</li>

      <h2>Data Sets, Data Files, and Descriptive Statistics</h2>

	  <p>Data sets have two representations in our model: a logical
      representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
      and a physical representation, which is a distribuited file
      holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
      different ways, even if the logical content is the same. In our

      (its organization into a set of variables (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code>)). The <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code>
      is an extension of the <code>dact:DataSet</code> class. Physical, distributed
      files are represented by the class <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code></b>, which is itself an
      extension of the <code>dcat:Distribution</code>. <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-descriptivestatistics" class="internalDFN">DescriptiveStatistics</a></code></b>

      <h3>LogicalDataSet</h3>
	  
      <p> 
	    Each study has a set of logical metadata (<b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code></b>) associated with 
	    the processing of data, at the time of collection or later during cleaning, and re-coding.

      <p>
	    <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code> is defined as a sub-class of <code>dcat:Dataset</code>.
		You can state a title (<code>dcterms:title</code>) and a flag indicating if the

	    You can specify access rights (<code>dcterms:accessRights</code>) and LicenseStatements
		(<code>dcterms:license</code>) for microdata datasets.
        For a <code><a href="#dfn-disco-logicaldataset" class="internalDFN">LogicalDataSet</a></code> the three dimensions of coverage can be specified:

      <h3>DataFile</h3>

	  <p>
	    The collected data result in the microdata represented by the <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code></b>.
	    Data sets have a logical representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
        and a physical representation, which is a distribuited file
        holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
        different ways, even if the logical content is the same. 
        data files (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-datafile" class="internalDFN">DataFile</a></code>), which are also <code>dcterms:Datasets</code> as well as <code>dcat:Distributions</code>,
        represents all the physical distributed data files containing the microdata datasets.

      <h3>DescriptiveStatistics</h3>

      <p>

		or the aggregated data. <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-descriptivestatistics" class="internalDFN">DescriptiveStatistics</a></code></b> may be minimal, maximal, mean values, 
		and absolute and relative frequencies. <code>qb:DataSet</code> originates from the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, 
		an approach to map the SDMX information model to an ontology. A <code>qb:DataSet</code> represents aggregated data 
		(also known as macrodata) such as multi-dimensional tables. Aggregated data are derived from microdata 
		by statistics on groups, or aggregates such as counts, means, or frequencies.
	    <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-summarystatistics" class="internalDFN">SummaryStatistics</a></code></b> pointing to variables and

		  Available category statistics types are frequency, percentage, and cumulativePercentage. 
		  Available summary statistics types are organized in the controlled vocabulary SummaryStatisticsType. It is represented in SKOS format, where each summary statistics type is a skos:Concept. Particular summary statistics types are included into a disco:SummaryStatistics class with the property disco:summaryStatisticType. The particular value is modelled with rdf:value. More information on the SKOS representation of the controlled vocabulary SummaryStatisticsType can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/linked-statistics/DDI-controlled-vocabularies">DDI-controlled-vocabularies project page</a>.

          There are two properties which describe details of a category or summary statistic value, computationBase and weightedBy.
		</p>
	  
        <p>		
          computationBase expresses if the cases - which are the basis of the computation of a statistics value - 
		  are valid, invalid or the total of both. The usage of computationBase for frequency differs from the usage for the 
		  percentage statistics and the summary statistics. A distinction regarding computationBase doesn’t apply to frequency as category statistic. 
		  The following table describes the details of usage of computationBase in dependency of the respective statistics type.

      <h3>skos:Concept and skos:ConceptScheme</h3>

	  <p>
	    SKOS defines the term <b><code>skos:Concept</code></b>, which is a unit of knowledge created by a unique 
		combination of characteristics. In context of statistical (meta)data, concepts 
		are abstract summaries, general notions, knowledge of a whole set of behaviours, 
		attitudes or characteristics which are seen as having something in common. 
		Concepts may be associated with variables and questions. 
		A <b><code>skos:ConceptScheme</code></b>, also defined within the SKOS namespace, is a set of metadata 
		describing statistical concepts. 
		<code>Skos:Concept</code> is reused to a large extent to represent DDI concepts, codes, and categories.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		DDI concepts can be described using <code>skos:definition</code>.
		Furthermore, you can describe code values (<code>skos:notation</code>) and category labels
        (<code>skos:prefLabel</code>).
        Hierarchies of DDI concepts can be built using the object properties <code>skos:broader</code> and <code>skos:narrower</code>.
		The domains and the ranges of <code>skos:broader</code> and <code>skos:narrower</code> are <code>skos:Concept</code>.
        The cardinalities are in both directions 0 to n.
        <code>Skos:Concept</code> may be organized in 0 to n <code>skos:ConceptSchemes</code> by means of <code>skos:inScheme</code>.
        <code>skos:ConceptSchemes</code> may have multiple (0 - n) <code>skos:Concept</code> as parts.
        The top concept in a specific ConceptScheme is indicated by <code>skos:hasTopConcept</code> pointing 
		to 0 to n top <code>skos:Concept</code>. A specific <code>skos:Concept</code> may be the top concept to multiple

        <h4>Uses of skos:OrderedCollection and skos:ConceptScheme </h4>
		<p>
		  In DDI, variables, questions, and categories are typically organized themselves in a particular order. For obtaining this order, <code>skos:OrderedCollection</code>s are used. For example, a collection of variables is represented as being of the type <code>skos:OrderedCollection</code> containing multiple variables (each represented as <code>skos:Concept</code>) in a <code>skos:memberList</code>.

      <h3>Representation</h3>

	  <p>
	    The <b><code><a href="#dfn-disco-representation" class="internalDFN">Representation</a></code></b> of a variable is the combination of a value domain, 
		datatype, and, if necessary, a unit of measure or a character set. 
		<code><a href="#dfn-disco-representation" class="internalDFN">Representation</a></code> is one of a set of values to which a numerical measure or a category 
		from a classification can be assigned (e.g. income, age, and sex: male coded as 1). 
		<code><a href="#dfn-disco-question" class="internalDFN">Questions</a></code> (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-responsedomain" class="internalDFN">ResponseDomain</a></code>), variables (<code><a href="#dfn-disco-variable" class="internalDFN">Variable</a></code>)

        representations.
		<code><a href="#dfn-disco-representation" class="internalDFN">Representation</a></code> is defined as sub-class of the union of <b><code>rdfs:Datatype</code></b> (e.g. numeric or
        textual values), <b><code>skos:ConceptScheme</code></b>, and <b><code>skos:OrderedCollection</code></b>, as for example questions
        may have as response domain a mixture of a numeric response domain containing numeric values (<code>rdfs:Datatype</code>) and 
		an unordered code response domain (<code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>) as well as an ordered code response domain (<code>skos:OrderedCollection</code>).

		describing formal statistical classifications using the SKOS Extension for Statistics (XKOS) [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-XKOS">XKOS</a></cite>], 
		and delineating code lists, category schemes, mappings between them, and concepts like topics 
		using the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-SKOS">SKOS</a></cite>]. Furthermore, the external vocabularies Friend of a Friend (FOAF) [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-FOAF">FOAF</a></cite>], 
		the Organization Ontology (ORG) [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ORG">ORG</a></cite>], the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ADMS">ADMS</a></cite>], and the PROV Ontology (PROV-O) [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-PROV-O">PROV-O</a></cite>] are used.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>

	  <section>
	  <h3>DCMI Metadata Terms (DCMI)</h3>
	  
	    <p>
	      DCMI is reused in order to describe general metadata of Disco constructs such as a study abstract (dcterms:abstract), 
		  a study or dataset title (dcterms:title), a human readable description of a Disco construct (dcterms:description), 
	  	  provenance information for a data file (dcterms:provenance), or the date (or date range) at which a study will become 
		  available (dcterms:available). 
	    </p>
	  
	  </section>
	  
	  <section>
	  <h3>Friend of a Friend (FOAF) and Organization Ontology (ORG)</h3>
	  
	  <p>
		With-in the context of Disco, FOAF as well as ORG are reused. Creators (dcterms:creator), 
		contributors (dcterms:contributor), and publishers (dcterms:publisher) of Studies and StudyGroups are foaf:Agents which 
		are either foaf:Persons or org:Organizations whose members are foaf:Persons. Studies and StudyGroups may be funded by (disco:fundedBy) foaf:Agents. 
		The object property disco:fundedBy is de-fined as sub-property of dcterms:contributor.
	  </p>
	  
	  </section>
	  
	  <section id="adms">
	  <h3>Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS)</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    Especially persons and organizations may hold one or more persistent identifiers of particular schemes and agencies 
		(e.g. ORCID, FundRef) that are not considered by the specific IDs of Disco. In order to include those identifiers 
		and for distinguishing between multiple identifiers for the same class, ADMS is utilized. As a profile of DCAT, 
		ADMS aims to describe semantic assets, i.e. reusable metadata and reference data. The class adms:Identifier can be 
		added to a rdfs:Resource by using the property adms:identifier. That identifier class can contain properties that define 
		the particular identifier itself, but also its scheme, version and managing agency. However, although utilized primarily 
		for describing identifiers of persons and organizations, it is allowed to attach an adms:Identifier class to all classes in Disco.

	  </section>
	  
	  <section>
	  <h3>PROV Ontology (PROV-O)</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    In order to represent detailed provenance information of Web data and metadata, classes and properties of PROV-O can be used. 
		Thus, it can be used as a natural vocabulary to attach provenance information to Disco metadata. 
		Terms of PROV-O are organized among three main classes: prov:Entity, prov:Activity and prov:Agent. 
		While classes of Disco can be represented either as entities or agents, particular processes for, 
		e.g. creating, maintaining and accessing data can be modeled as activities. Properties like prov:wasGeneratedBy, 
		prov:hadPrimarySource, prov:wasInvalidatedBy, or prov:wasDerivedFrom describe the relationship between classes 
		for the generation of data in more detail. In order to link from a disco:Study to its original DDI XML file, 
		the property prov:wasDerivedFrom can be used. Moreover, PROV-O allows for representing versioning information by e.g., 
		using the terms prov:Revision, prov:hadGeneration and prov:hadUsage.

		<p>
		  Within the context of Disco, we reuse other well elaborated and accepted vocabularies as often as possible and reasonable. 
		  DCMI, FOAF, ORG, ADMS, and PROV-O build one block of complementary vocabularies. Their use is shown in one combined use case. 
		  DCMI is used in order to describe general metadata, FOAF and ORG are used to describe persons and organizations, 
		  we use ADMS for the persistent identification of objects like persons and organizations, and PROV-O is used to provide provenance information. 
		  A typical scenario within the social sciences community could be the following one:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li>
		    John (foaf:person) aggregates (disco:aggregation) microdata datasets (disco:LogicalDataSet) which are associated with (disco:product) the European study EU-SILC (disco:Study). The aggregate dataset is represented using qb:DataSet. The prov:Agent :john was associated with (prov:wasAssociatedWith) the prov:Activity :aggregationActivity. The :aggregationActivity used (prov:used) the prov:Entity :europeanDataSet (a European dataset), and generated (prov:wasGeneratedBy) a new prov:Entity :aggregatedEuropeanDataSet that aggregates the microdata in :europeanDataSet. The prov:Agent :john acted on behalf of (prov:actedOnBehalfOf) the organization :deri (prov:Agent, org:Organization). The European study (disco:Study) was funded by (disco:fundedBy) the research institution GESIS (org:Organization) for which John is working for (org:memberOf). In order to identify foaf:Persons and org:Organizations permanently, the object property adms:identifier is used pointing to adms:Identifiers. Further possible example queries using the vocabularies TERMS, FOAF, ORG, ADMS, and PROV-O would be:Which persons (foaf:Person), working for (org:memberOf) the research institute GESIS (org:Organization) created (dcterms:creator) the survey ALLBUS (Germany General Social Survey), which is a particular group of studies (disco:StudyGroup) in Germany?
		  </li>

		    Which organizations (org:Organization) and which persons (foaf:Person) contributed (dcterms:contributor) to the creation of the European study EU-SILC (disco:Study)?

	  <h3>Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    Skos:Concept is reused to a large extent to represent DDI concepts, codes, and categories. 
		SKOS defines the term skos:Concept, which is a unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics. 
		In context of statistical (meta)data, concepts are abstract summaries, general notions, knowledge of a whole set of behaviours, 
		attitudes or characteristics which are seen as having something in common. Skos:Concepts may be associated with variables, 
		variable definitions, and questions and are reused to a large extent to represent DDI concepts (skos:prefLabel), 
		codes (skos:notation), and category labels (skos:prefLabel). Skos:Concepts may be organized in skos:ConceptSchemes (skos:inScheme), 
		sets of metadata describing statis-tical concepts. Hierarchies of DDI concepts can be built using the object peoperties 
		skos:broader and skos:narrower. Topical coverage can be expressed using dcterms:subject. Disco foresees the use of skos:Concept 
		for the description of topical coverage. Spatial, temporal, and topical coverage are directly attached to studies, logical datasets, 
		and datafiles. Universes and AnalysisUnits are also skos:Concepts. Therefore the properties defined for skos:Concept can be reused. 
		KindOfData, pointing to a skos:Concept , describes, with a string or a term from a controlled vocabulary, the kind of data documented 
		in the logical product(s) of a Study. Using dcterms:format, DataFiles formats can be defined.
	  </p>
	  
	  </section>
	  
	  <section>
	  <h3>SKOS Extension for Statistics (XKOS)</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    The use of formal statistical classifications is very common in research datasets - these are treated in Disco as SKOS concepts, 
		but in some cases those working with formal statistical classifications may desire more expressive capability than SKOS provides. 
		To support such users, the DDI Alliance also develops XKOS, a vocabulary which extends SKOS to allow 
		for a more complete description of such classifications [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-eXtended-Knowledge-Organization-System">eXtended Knowledge Organization System</a></cite>].
		While the use of XKOS is not required by this vocabulary, the two are designed to work in complementary fashion. 
		SKOS properties may be substituted by additional XKOS properties.
	  </p>
	  
	  <div class="example">
		<div class="example-title">
          <span>Which Datasets Have A Specific Statistical Classification and What Are Its Semantic Relations?</span>
	    </div>
		
		<p>
XKOS extends SKOS with two main objectives: the first one is to allow the descrip-tion of statistical classifications, 
the second one is to introduce refinements of the semantic properties defined in SKOS. 
The semantic properties extend the possible relations that can be applied between pairs of skos:Concepts. 
SKOS allows the following relations: skos:broader than, skos:narrower than, and skos:related to. The first two are hierarchical relations, one in each direction. 
In Disco, these SKOS properties may be substituted by additional XKOS properties like xkos:generalizes, xkos:hasPart, xkos:caused, xkos:previous, and xkos:next.
        </p>
		<p>
One question, typically asked by social science researchers, could be to query all the datasets (disco:LogicalDataSet) 
which have a specific statistical classifi-cation (skos:ConceptScheme) like ISCO (International Standard Classification of Occupations) 
or ANZSIC (Australian and New Zealand Industry Classification). It is also possible to query on the semantic relationships 
which are defined for statistical classifications using XKOS properties. By means of these properties not only hierarchical relations can be queries 
but also for example part of relationships (xkos:hasPart), more general (xkos:generalizes) and more specific (xkos:specializes) concepts, 
and positions of concepts in lists (xkos:previous, xkos:next).

	  <section>
	  <h3>Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    DCAT is a W3C standard for describing catalogs of datasets. DCAT makes few assumptions about the kind of datasets being described, 
		and focuses on general metadata about the datasets (mostly using Dublin Core), and on different ways of distributing and accessing the dataset, 
		including availability of the dataset in multiple formats. Combining terms from both DCAT and Disco can be useful for a number of reasons:
	  </p>
	    <ul>
		  <li>Describing collections (catalogs) of research datasets</li>
		  <li>Providing additional information about physical aspects (file size, file formats) of research data files</li>
		  <li>Providing information about the data collection that produced the datasets in a data catalog</li>
		  <li>Providing information about the logical structure (variables, concepts, etc.) of tabular datasets in a data catalog</li>
		</ul>
	  
	  <p>
	    The LogicalDataSet is an extension of the dcat:DataSet. Physical, dis-tributed files are represented by the DataFile, 
		which is itself an extension of dcat:Distribution.
	  </p>

	  <section>
	  <h3>RDF Data Cube Vocabulary</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary is a W3C standard for representing data cubes, that is, multidimensional aggregate data. 
		A <code>qb:DataSet</code> represents aggregate data such as multi-dimensional tables. 
		Aggregate data is derived from microdata by statistics on groups, or aggregates such as counts, means, or frequencies. 
		Data cubes are often generated by tabulating or aggregating unit-record datasets. 
		For example, if an observation in a census data cube indicates the population of a certain age group in a certain region is 12345, 
		then this fact was obtained by aggregating that number of individual records from a unit-record dataset. 
		Disco contains a property “aggregation” that indicates that a Cube dataset was derived by tabulating a unit-record dataset. 
		Data Cube provides for the description of the structure of such cubes, but also for the representation of the cube data itself, 
		that is, the observations that make up the cube dataset [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Semantic-Statistics">Semantic Statistics</a></cite>]. This is not the case for Disco, 
		which only describes the structure of a da-taset, but is not concerned with representing the actual data in it. 
		The actual data are assumed to sit in a data file (e.g. a CSV  file, or in a proprietary statistical package file format) that is not represented in RDF.

    <section id='mapping-from-DDI-XML-to-DDI-RDF'><h2>DDI-XML Bidirectional Mappings</h2>

<p>
In this section, bidirectional mappings between disco and DDI Lifecycle (DDI-L) is provided. 
It allows an easy adoption of the DDI Discovery Vocabulary for existing DDI metadata. 
XSLTs for converting any XML output of DDI Codebook (DDI-C) and DDI-L are available at the 
<a href="https://github.com/linked-statistics/DDI-RDF-tools">DDI-RDF-tools project page</a>.
</p>

<b>Official Mapping Document</b>
<p>
There is also an official document containing all bidirectional mappings between disco and DDI-L: 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnXXOuMQghwxdG1wU1EzLVJybHp6SDI5ZHJOTUlzOVE&usp=sharing">official mapping document</a>
These mapping tables will be transformed to the official specification in form of a turtle file and in form of html tables in this html specification.
</p>

<b>Bidirectional Mappings between Disco and DDI-L</b>
<ul>
	<li>DDI-L &#10513; disco. This should be a straight-forward mapping for all items used in disco.</li>
    <li>disco &#10513; DDI-L. This should be a straight-forward mapping for all items in the disco namespace.</li>
	<li>Only the standard XPath expression is defined as mapping (although there are several other XPath expressions for each mapping)</li>
	<li>Context:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The items from other vocabularies - used in disco - need a context; then there could be a clear mapping path.</li>
		<li>We need context information for mappings, as for example skos:notation can be mapped to variable labels and to codes.</li>
		<li>Context information can be either a SPARQL query or an informal description as plain literal.</li>
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<b>Mappings between Disco and other Versions of DDI-XML</b>
<p>
In order to avoid inconsistencies (as mapping tables may changes over time), we only offer mappings between disco and the concrete version DDI 3.1 od DDI-L.
There are various mapping documents between DDI 3.1 and other DDI versions (like DDI 3.2 and DDI 2.1) on the <a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/">DDI Alliance website</a>.
</p>

<b>Mappings between Disco and DDI 4</b>
<p>
DDI 4 will be the next model-driven specification of DDI including mappings to multiple representations such as RDF, XML, relational databases, and Java. 
DDI 4 should have a clear mapping from DDI-XML 3.2. 
We assume that all items used in disco will have a clear mapping to DDI-XML 3.2, 
and these items in DDI-XML 3.2 will have a clear mapping to items in the DDI 4 model (therefore to a representation in OWL/RDF as well). 
If the latter shouldn't be possible, then a mapping of items in DDI-XML 3.2 to DDI 4 XML and DDI 4 RDF should be possible. 
</p>

<b>Turtle File Containing Mappings in RDF</b>
<p>
The mappings are defined within a separate turtle file
<ul>
<li>in order to execute SPARQL queries on the turtle file</li>
<li>in order to generate mapping tables for the html spec out of the turtle file</li>
<li>there is 1 turtle file containing mappings for disco axioms and axioms of reused external vocabularies</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>Mapping Tables</b>
<ul>
	<li>The follwoing mapping tables are generated out of the official mapping document completely automatically to avoid inconsistencies.</li>
	<li>The mapping tables are structured in classes, object, and data properties.</li>
	<li>There can be classes and properties specified within the disco namespace or within any other namespace which are then used by disco.</li> 
</ul>

      <h2>Use Cases and Example Queries</h2>

	  <p>
	      Vompras, Gregory, Bosch, Capadisli, and Wackerow [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Scenarios">Scenarios</a></cite>] have written a paper describing typical use cases associated with the DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary. 
	      The specification the DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary does not contain the full list of all the possible use cases. The complete list can be found in the mentioned paper.
	      We now show a couple of representative use cases associated with the DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary.

<h4>Representing relationships between persons, organizations and datasets</h4>


		
		<p>
			Within the context of Disco, we reuse other well elaborated and accepted vocabularies as often as possible and reasonable. 
			DCMI, FOAF, ORG, ADMS, and PROV-O build one block of complementary vocabularies. Their use is shown in one combined use case. 
			DCMI is used in order to describe general metadata, FOAF and ORG are used to describe persons and organizations, 
			we use ADMS for the persistent identification of objects like persons and organizations, and PROV-O is used to provide provenance information. 
			A typical scenario within the social sciences community could be the following one:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				John (foaf:person) aggregates (disco:aggregation) microdata datasets (disco:LogicalDataSet) which are associated with 
				(disco:product) the European study EU-SILC (disco:Study). The aggregate dataset is represented using qb:DataSet. 
				The prov:Agent :john was associated with (prov:wasAssociatedWith) the prov:Activity :aggregationActivity. 
				The :aggregationActivity used (prov:used) the prov:Entity :europeanDataSet (a European dataset), and generated (prov:wasGeneratedBy) 
				a new prov:Entity :aggregatedEuropeanDataSet that aggregates the microdata in :europeanDataSet. 
				The prov:Agent :john acted on behalf of (prov:actedOnBehalfOf) the organization :deri (prov:Agent, org:Organization). 
				The European study (disco:Study) was funded by (disco:fundedBy) the research institution GESIS (org:Organization) 
				for which John is working for (org:memberOf). In order to identify foaf:Persons and org:Organizations permanently, 
				the object property adms:identifier is used pointing to adms:Identifiers. 
				Further possible example queries using the vocabularies TERMS, FOAF, ORG, ADMS, and PROV-O would be: Which persons (foaf:Person), 
				working for (org:memberOf) the research institute GESIS (org:Organization), created (dcterms:creator) the survey ALLBUS (Germany General Social Survey),
				which is a particular group of studies (disco:StudyGroup) in Germany?
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Which organizations (org:Organization) and which persons (foaf:Person) contributed (dcterms:contributor) to the creation of the European study EU-SILC (disco:Study)?
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Which persistent identifier (adms:identifier) are assigned to persons and organizations (foaf:Agent) 
				publishing (dcterms:publisher) the European study EU-LFS (disco:Study)?
			</li>

      <h4>Representing datasets using specific statistical classifications</h4>
	


		
		<p>
			XKOS extends SKOS with two main objectives: the first one is to allow the description of statistical classifications, 
			the second one is to introduce refinements of the semantic properties defined in SKOS. 
			The semantic properties extend the possible relations that can be applied between pairs of skos:Concepts. 
			SKOS allows the following relations: skos:broader than, skos:narrower than, and skos:related to. 
			The first two are hierarchical relations, one in each direction. 
			In Disco, these SKOS properties may be substituted by additional XKOS properties like 
			xkos:generalizes, xkos:hasPart, xkos:caused, xkos:previous, and xkos:next.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			One question, typically asked by social science researchers, could be to query all the datasets (disco:LogicalDataSet) 
			which have a specific statistical classification (skos:ConceptScheme) like ISCO (International Standard Classification of Occupations) or 
			ANZSIC (Australian and New Zealand Industry Classification). It is also possible to query on the semantic relationships 
			which are defined for statistical classifications using XKOS properties. 
			By means of these properties not only hierar-chical relations can be queried but also for example part of relationships (xkos:hasPart), 
			more general (xkos:generalizes) and more specific (xkos:specializes) concepts, and positions of concepts in lists (xkos:previous, xkos:next).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The following figure gives an example inspired by the ANZSIC (Australian and New Zealand Industry Classification), 
			which is a classification covering the field of economic activity. 
			A small excerpt is shown here, limited to the classification object itself and its levels, 
			as well as one item of the most detailed level (Class 6720 – Real Estate Services) and its parent items. 
			Note that the URI employed in this example are entirely fictitious, since the ANZSIC has not yet been published as RDF.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			For clarity, the properties of the classification items (code, labels, notes) have not been included in the figure.
		</p>
		
		<div class="figure">
			<img src="images/example-anzsic.png" alt="Statistical classification – ANZSIC"/>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			On the left of the figure is the skos:ConceptScheme instance that corresponds to the ANZIC 2006 classification scheme, 
			with its various SKOS and Dublin Core properties. Additionnal XKOS properties indicate that the classification has four levels and covers 
			the field of economic activity, represented here as a concept from the EuroVoc thesaurus. In this case, the coverage is intended 
			to be exhaustive and without overlap, so xkos:coversExhaustively and xkos:coversMutuallyExclusively could have been used together instead of xkos:covers.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The four levels are instances of xkos:ClassificationLevel; they are organized as a rdf:List which is attached to the classification 
			by the xkos:levels property. Some level information has been represented on the top level, for example its depth in the classification 
			(xkos:depth) and the concept that characterizes the items it is composed of (xkos:organizedBy). In the same fashion, concepts of subdivision, 
			group and class could be created to describe the items of the lower levels.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The usual SKOS properties are used to connect the classification items to their respective level (skos:member) and to the classification 
			(skos:inScheme or its specialization skos:topConceptOf) for the items of the first level). Similarly, skos:narrower is used to express the 
			hierarchical relations between the items, but the subproperties defined in this specification could also be used. For example, xkos:hasPart 
			could express the partitive relation between subdivision 67 ("Property Operators and Real Estate Services") and group 672 ("Real Estate Services").
		</p>
	
	
      <h4>Representing relationships between datasets, collections and data catalogs</h4>
	
      

        <p>While Disco and Data Cube provide terms for the description of datasets, both on a different level of aggregation, DCAT enables the representation of these datasets inside of data collections like repositories, catalogs or archives. The relationship be-tween data collections and their contained datasets is useful, since such collections are a typical entry point when searching for data.</p>
        
        <p>A search for data may consist of two phases. In a first phase, the user searches for different records described by dcat:CatalogRecord inside a data catalog. This search can differ according to the users’ information need. While it is possible to search for metadata provided inside such a record like dcterms:title, dcterms:description, etc., the user can also formulate a query to search for more detailed information about the dataset (represented as dcat:Dataset) or its distribution (dcat:Distribution), which are part of the record. For example, a user may want to search for datasets covering a particular topic (dcat:keyword), particular temporal and spatial coverages (dcterms:temporal and dcterms:spatial), or particular formats in which a distribution of the data is available (dcterms:format). Instances of dcat:DataSet are also described by specific themes they cover (dcat:theme). Since these themes are organized in a theme taxonomy (implemented by a skos:ConceptScheme and classes of skos:Concept), these themes can also be used for an overall search in all datasets of the data catalog.</p>
        
        <p>Nevertheless, the search of the first phase will result in one or presumably multiple hits of datasets. Hence, another search has to be executed in a second phase in order to find out which datasets are relevant for the user, e.g. particular universes or sam-ples. The search regarding particular criteria in multiple Disco datasets materializes as those described in the previous two use case sections and those presented in [9]. However, the user may find data sets which are published in Data Cube. In order to discover the original microdata source of a qb:DataSet, the property prov:wasDerivedFrom can hold the link the particular DDI data set dis-co:Study.</p>
        <p>A user searching for data regarding dissatisfaction with politics in Europe may find the records :EuropeanStudy and :AggregatedEuropeanData in a :DataCatalog. By analyzing the information given in the themes and keywords of the associated data sets, the user can decide which data set is best suitable for his information need. He notices also that :AggregatedEuropeanDataset has been derived from :EuropeanDataset and seems to cover only a subset of the micro data set. If he is interested in the micro data instead of aggregated data, he is thus able to find the underlying micro data set.</p>
